I first start by reading the mushroom.csv file I give it a name. After that I have a variable set as the first class, or column, of the row in the csv file. Then while there is still a next row to be read, the file will compare the class value of the mushroom by matching letters to see whether it is poisonous or edible and prints out a statement saying so. The output will be all the mushrooms numbered and classified on its edibility, 1 is skipped as that is legend for all attributes.
